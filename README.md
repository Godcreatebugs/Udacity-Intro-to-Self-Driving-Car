# Intro to Self Driving Cars

This nanodegree is more focusd towards practical implementation of the self driving framworks. I have learned to apply
**_control techniques combined with motion planning and computer vision._**


### Bayesian Thinking and probability
A mathematical introduction of probability and baye's theorm based on which self driving rejects errors in their sensors.

### Project: Joy Ride
This project is for simulation environment introduction from udacity. This helps to understand dynamics with Unity engine based simulation in chrome.

### Project: Implement a Matrix Class
C++ Basics
This course is the first step in a rewarding journey towards C++ expertise. The goal is translation: get a program written in Python, and translate it into C++.

### Performance Programming in C++
Explore how to write good code that runs correctly. We’ll focus primarily on low level features of C++, but we’ll discuss other best practices as well.

### Navigating Data Structures
Algorithmic thinking is a skill you’ll refine throughout your career. In this course you’ll focus on frequently used data structures and algorithms.

### Vehicle Motion and Control
This course is a crash course in two branches of mathematics which are crucial to self driving cars: calculus and trigonometry. You will learn how a self driving car uses various motion sensors to help it understand its own motion.

At the end of this course you will use raw sensor data (which give information about distance driven, acceleration, and rotation rates) to reconstruct a vehicle's trajectory through space.

### Computer Vision and Machine Learning
In this course you’ll learn how a computer sees an image, and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically. **In this project i get 100% accuracy**
