# Intro to Self Driving Cars

This nanodegree is more focusd towards practical implementation of the self driving framworks. I have learned to apply
**_control techniques combined with motion planning and computer vision._**


### Bayesian Thinking and probability
A mathematical introduction of probability and baye's theorm based on which self driving rejects errors in their sensors.

### Project0: Joy Ride
This project is for simulation environment introduction from udacity. This helps to understand dynamics with Unity engine based simulation in chrome.

### Project 1: Implementation of histogram filter
This project is basically the probabilty visualization after car moves in particular direction. This is a jupyter notebook homework.

### Project 2: Matrix class implementation 
Built a python file that allows user to do addition,subtraction,multiplication,transpose and inverse like normal matrix.

### Project 3:Translate Python to Cpp
This is the project where I have to convert the python files from histogram project to c++ with high performance.

### Project 4:Optimize histogram filter

At the end of this course you will use raw sensor data (which give information about distance driven, acceleration, and rotation rates) to reconstruct a vehicle's trajectory through space.

### Computer Vision and Machine Learning
In this course youâ€™ll learn how a computer sees an image, and how we can use machine learning to teach a computer to identify images programmatically. **In this project i get 100% accuracy**
